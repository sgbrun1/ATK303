<p id="lyrics">No matter how hard I try<br>
  You keep pushing me aside<br>
  And I can't break through<br>
  There's no talking to you
  <br><br>
  It's so sad that you're leaving<br>
  It takes time to believe it<br>
  But after all is said and done<br>
  You're gonna be the lonely one<br>
  Oh, oh
  <br><br>
  Do you believe in life after love?<br>
  I can feel something inside me say,<br>
  "I really don't think you're strong enough, no."<br>
  Do you believe in life after love?<br>
  I can feel something inside me say,<br>
  "I really don't think you're strong enough, no."
  <br><br>
  What am I supposed to do?<br>
  Sit around and wait for you?<br>
  Well, I can't do that<br>
  There's no turning back<br>
  <br>
  I need time to move on<br>
  I need love to feel strong<br>
  'Cause I've had time to think it through<br>
  And maybe I'm too good for you<br>
  Oh, oh
  <br><br>
  Do you believe in life after love?<br>
  I can feel something inside me say,<br>
  "I really don't think you're strong enough, no."<br>
  Do you believe in life after love?<br>
  I can feel something inside me say,<br>
  "I really don't think you're strong enough, no."
  <br><br>
  Well, I know that I'll get through this<br>
  'Cause I know that I am strong<br>
  I don't need you anymore<br>
  Oh, I don't need you anymore<br>
  I don't need you anymore<br>
  No, I don't need you anymore
  <br><br>
  Do you believe in life after love?<br>
  I can feel something inside me say,<br>
  "I really don't think you're strong enough, no."<br>
  Do you believe in life after love?<br>
  I can feel something inside me say,<br>
  "I really don't think you're strong enough, no."
  <br><br>
  Do you believe in life after love?<br>
  I can feel something inside me say,<br>
  "I really don't think you're strong enough, no."<br>
  Do you believe in life after love?<br>
  I can feel something inside me say,<br>
  "I really don't think you're strong enough, no." </p>
